## About

This project is a basic type inference algorithm for the Haskell language. Written in Prolog, 
this algorithm provides a type inference mechanism for the basic structures of a functional
programming language, based on the syntax of Haskell. Actually quite fun.




## How to Run the Code

* Navigate to the directory with "typeInf.pl" 
* Start the SWI Prolog Interpreter
* Load the code by entering
```bash
[typeInf].
```
* Run unit tests by entering
```bash
?- consult("typeInf.plt"), run_tests().
```



## Features

1. Basic functions (Arithmetic and Relational operators)
2. Global variable declarations
3. Global function declarations
4. Function calls
5. "If" statements
6. "Let in" statements (Local variables)
7. "Where" statements (Local variables)
8. Expression computation and code blocks
